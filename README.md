# Flight Customer Segmentation Analysis

A Streamlit web application that performs customer segmentation for airlines using K-Means clustering. This tool helps identify distinct passenger groups based on flight behavior patterns like flight frequency, distance traveled, points earned, and discount usage.

## Key Features:
- Interactive clustering with adjustable parameters
- Visualizations of customer segments
- Cluster characteristics analysis
- Data preprocessing pipeline
- Export functionality for results

## Tech Stack:
- Python
- Streamlit (for web interface)
- Scikit-learn (K-Means clustering)
- Pandas (data processing)
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (visualizations)

## Use Cases:
- Customer lifetime value prediction
- Targeted marketing campaigns
- Loyalty program optimization
- Service personalization

The app follows CRISP-DM methodology with complete data preprocessing similar to real-world airline data scenarios.
